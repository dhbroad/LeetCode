# closest numbers
# for a list of numbers, return all of the pairs of numbers that have the lowest difference between them.

# Given an array of distinct integers, determine the minimum absolute difference between any two elements.
# Print all element pairs with that difference in ascending order.ord

# Example
# numbers = [6,2,4,10]
# the minimum absolute difference is 2 and the pairs with that difference are (2,4) and (4,6). When printing element pairs (i,j), they should be ordered ascending first by i and then by j.bytearray
# 2 4
# 4 6

# Function description
# Complete the function closestNumbers in the editor.



# break a palindrome
# has to be lower and no longer be a palindrome
